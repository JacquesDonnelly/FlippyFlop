You are proof that God has a good sence of humour.
If I throw a stick, will you leave?
I like the way you try.
It is impossible to underestimate you.
I'm jelous of the people who haven't met you.
I like your approach. Now let's see your departure.
You're a grey sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake.
Hold still, I'm trying to imagine you with personality.
You make onions cry.
I'm not insulting you, I'm describing you.
Keep rolling your eyes, you might find a brain.
You're like a cloud. Beautiful when gone.
OH MY GOD! IT SPEAKS!
You're the reason the gene pool needs a life guard.
If laughter is medicine, your face is curing the world.
I'd agree with you but then I'd be wrong.
